### Project Info

This project simulates a chat server where multiple clients can be connected to it and broadcast messages. After you compile (the project was created using **Microsoft Visual C++ compiler**) and run this project you can use PuTTY (for simplicity) as a client application that connects to the server as in the below images. In my example server runs on the localhost on port 54000.
